## Apartment data

A script which scrapes a dummy [**Zillow**](https://appbrewery.github.io/Zillow-Clone/ "https://appbrewery.github.io/Zillow-Clone/") webpage in order to obtain data on the apartment rental offers. Data is then used to fill out a Google Form, the information from which can be later converted into a Google Sheet. Scraping results are saved in a JSON file.
